## Project Summary

This SQL-driven project involves analyzing a Spotify music dataset containing detailed information about songs, albums, and artists. The dataset, originally in a flattened structure, is explored through a structured workflow involving data retrieval, aggregation, transformation, and advanced analytical techniques using SQL.
